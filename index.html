        <br />
        MCA INTELIFUNDS LTD, trading as “FXORO”, is a financial services company
        incorporated and registered under the laws of the Republic of Cyprus,
        licensed and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission
        (CySEC) with license number 126/10. <br /><br />

        Risk disclaimer <br /><br />
        CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money
        rapidly due to leverage. 75.28% of retail investor accounts lose money
        when trading CFDs with this provider. You should consider whether you
        understand how CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high
        risk of losing your money. <br /><br />
        The National Securities Market commission of Spain (the “CNMV”) has
        determined that, due to the complexity of CFDs and the risks involved,
        the purchase of such a product by Retail Clients is not
        appropriate/suitable. In this respect, pursuant to the relevant
        requirements introduced by CNMV, you are warned that you are about to
        purchase a product that is complex and difficult to understand:
        Contracts for Differences (CFDs). CNMV has determined that, due to its
        complexity and the risks involved, the purchase of this product by
        retail investors is not appropriate/suitable. <br /><br />
        Because of such, CFDs may not be the ideal investment for everyone. The
        high rate of leverage that is available to CFD traders can work for or
        against you. You should only invest money that you can afford to lose.
        CFDs are intricate leveraged financial assets. Trading Forex,
        Commodities, Indexes and Shares based CFDs, or any other underlaying
        instruments of the Company implies a high degree of risk and can lead to
        the loss of your investment. Before getting involved with trading,
        consider your financial goals, your skills and gage the possible risks
        associated with trading Company's Products. Derivate assets like CFDs
        and likely instruments from other markets can present extreme
        volatility. CFDs may shift price rapidly and may depict change in market
        conditions that result from unforeseeable occurrences. None of these
        facts can be manipulated by either you or FXORO. It is best to consult
        with a licensed financial counselor. FXORO does not avail its customers
        with financial advice and the information provided herein is intended
        for marketing purposes only. Past performance is not an indicator for
